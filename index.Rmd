# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

# Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

## Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



## Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')


```


## Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
  
```



# Assignment. 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 


##Dygraph example

```{r}
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)
```




## Poudre Paragraph

The Poudre River is divided into three main sections; upper, middle and lower. **These sections can broadly be described as the [High Elevation Mountain Stream, The Urban Transition Zone, and the Lower Prairie Zone](https://arcg.is/WS1m8)**. The different characteristics of the zones in the river impact the fish wildlife found there. The Upper zone, dominated by snowmelt and runoff, has a higher velocity, and Brown Trout are the dominant species here. The Lower Zone is less confined by bedrock and has a lower velocity which results in a meandering stream with finer sediment.The dominant species in this region are the Fathead Minnow, Red Shiner, Creek Chub, and other small native species. [The Urban Transition Zone](https://www.fcgov.com/poudrereportcard/pdf/sopr2016.pdf) is an interesting area in the river because *it exhibits characteristics from both the Upper and Lower Reaches*. The transition zone through Fort Collins also has some obstacles the smaller fish mush face such as channelization and diversions. These are not the only stressors in the Poudre on the fish community; *other stressors include soot and debris from wildfires, changes in flow, and changes in water temperature due to [irrigation](https://www.fcgov.com/utilities/what-we-do/wastewater/treating-wastewater) and climate change*.
